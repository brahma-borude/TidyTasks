# TidyTasks
TidyTasks is a simple and functional Todo app built using Django. This is my first Django project, which I developed to learn the basics of web development with Django. The app allows users to create, update, and delete tasks, providing a clean interface for managing daily activities and keeping track of important to-dos.
