# TidyTasks
TidyTasks is a simple and functional Todo app built using Django. This is my first Django project, which I developed to learn the basics of web development with Django. The app allows users to create, update, and delete tasks, providing a clean interface for managing daily activities and keeping track of important to-dos.

Features
User Authentication: Allows users to register, log in, and manage their personal tasks.
Task Management: Users can create, update, and delete tasks easily.
Task Status: Mark tasks as complete or pending.
Database Integration: All tasks are stored in a database for persistence.
